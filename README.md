# Disaster Recovery Plan Using IBM Cloud Virtual Servers

## Introduction

This repository contains the disaster recovery plan for safeguarding business operations by developing a plan that ensures continuity for an on-premises virtual machine in unforeseen events. The plan includes setting up backup strategies, configuring replication, testing the recovery process, and guaranteeing minimal downtime. The project encompasses defining the disaster recovery strategy, implementing backup and replication, validating recovery procedures, and ensuring business continuity using IBM Cloud Virtual Servers.

## Define Your Disaster Recovery Strategy

- Identify key virtual machines and data to protect.
- Determine Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
- Consider budget, resources, and required protection levels.

## Select the Right IBM Cloud Services

- Choose suitable IBM Cloud Virtual Server configurations and services.
- Tailor configurations to meet specific requirements.

## Implement Backup Strategies

- Set up regular backups for on-premises virtual machines.
- Implement a backup schedule aligned with RPO.

## Configure Replication

- Create real-time copies of on-premises virtual machine data in IBM Cloud.
- Ensure replication meets RTO and RPO objectives.

## Test the Recovery Process

- Regularly test disaster recovery procedures.
- Conduct planned failovers and failbacks.
- Document and review test results and issues.

## Ensure Minimal Downtime

- Implement failover and failback plans.
- Use load balancing and high availability configurations.

## Document the Disaster Recovery Plan

- Create a comprehensive document with step-by-step instructions, contacts, and roles.
- Keep the document up to date and accessible.

## Train Your Team

- Ensure the IT team is proficient in executing the plan.
- Conduct regular drills to maintain proficiency.

## Monitor and Review

- Implement monitoring and alerting systems.
- Regularly review and update the disaster recovery plan.

## Compliance and Security

- Ensure plan compliance with regulations.
- Implement security measures for data protection.

## Documentation and Reporting

- Maintain documentation of all disaster recovery activities.
- Generate regular reports for stakeholders.

## Periodic Audits and Maintenance

- Conduct periodic audits for improvement.
- Keep IBM Cloud Virtual Server configurations up to date.
